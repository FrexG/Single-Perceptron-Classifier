# Single-Perceptron-Classifier
A linear classifier using a single perceptron implemented in Processing(Java)
--------------------------------------------------
-> This simple classifier consists of a sigle perceptron with two inputs,corresponding to x and y axis of the canvas.
-> The perceptron utilizes back propagation(Chain rule) to optimize the weights.
-> Sigmoid Activation Function is used

-> The model can be trained by varrying the inputs size and the number Epochs found in the Train.pde file
